# Krampus Hunter

## About this Project
I'd heard about this old computer game called Hunt the Wumpus developed by Gregory Yob. Gregory published it in The Best of Creative Computing Volume 1 (1976) to teach and inspire other computer programmers to learn programming.

So I decided to create version for the web based on the logic found in the article. One the goals I've set to for this project is to create version that is geared for mobile play (small screens).

Overall, the basic game play is the same except for the addition of a roaming Zombie who will move about and force you to run in the opposite direction, if you run into him. I've also themed it based on the myth of the Krampus (scary).

It's still a work in progress. I'm working on graphics at the moment as well as sound effects. My hope is to launch a Version 1.0 by Christmas.

## The Game

You are traveling adventurer who has been hired by a local village to eliminate the dreaded Krampus. If you don't, he will terrorize the children of the village on Christmas Eve.

## The Location
The Krampus is located in a remote cave in the mountains outside the village. The cave is dark and full of danger. In order to have the element of surprise, you carry no torch with you. You must rely on your sense of hearing to tell what evils lay ahead and ultimately, the Krampus.

## The Play
As you move about the cave's various rooms and passages, you will often "hear" clues as to what could be lurking in the next room. Based on that and your knowledge of where you've been, you'll narrow down where the Krampus is hiding and the kill him once and for all!

## The Goal
While exploring a sinister cave is all well and good, your goal is to kill the Krampus. In order to do that you will need a weapon. A sword would get you too close to the beast, so you have opted to bring your bow. But to remain light and keep the noise down, you've only brought three arrows.

Once you've located the Krampus, you will shoot your arrow into an adjoining room. If you hit, he is dead! But if you miss, he will awake and could very well run into your room and eat you alive.


## The Danger
The cave is home to perils like you've never seen or heard of before. Some living, some not. All bad.

### The Bottomless Pit
There are two bottomless pits in the cave. If you happen to fall in one, you will surely fall to your death.

### The Giant Bat
There are two Giant Bats in the cave. If you stumble upon them, they will transport you to a random room in the cave. The results of which could be quite disastrous.

### The Zombie
There is a Zombie roaming the passages of the cave. Sometimes it will lurk in a room and sometimes it will move about. If you happen to run into it, it will force to fell into a random, adjoining room.

### The Krampus
The Krampus sleeps, dreaming of all torment he will bring to the children this Christmas. If you walk into his room, he will awake and devour you whole. Make sure you get him before he gets you.
